#This is the screenplay file
#Format is delay after previous line in seconds, speaker, line
#The speaker can be red or tasbot and it is case insensitive so feel free to use TasBot or Tasbot or whatever
#Whitespace between those three items is ignored but whitespace in text is preserved
#And of course any lines starting with # are comments
1 Red Hello from TheAxeBot
5 Red I am just reading from a simple screenplay text file
3 Tasbot There are some lines for tasbot too
1 red I can now filter urls
