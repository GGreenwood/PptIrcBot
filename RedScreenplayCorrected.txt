#This is the screenplay file
#Format is delay after previous line in seconds, speaker, line
#The speaker can be red or tasbot and it is case insensitive so feel free to use TasBot or Tasbot or whatever
#Whitespace between those three items is ignored but whitespace in text is preserved
#And of course any lines starting with # are comments
#Note, 2015-12-26 - some of the lines below had palette shifts in bad places, this swaps lines and corrects timings but makes no other text changes
